<h2>Programs using framework ported to sndio</h2>

<h3>jack</h3>

<ul>
<li>audio/ardour
</ul>


<h3>sdl</h3>

<ul>
<li>devel/sdl-mixer
<li>devel/sdlmm
<li>graphics/ffmpeg
</ul>

<h3>libao</h3>

Someone requested a "buffer_size" know to control
the latency.

But this can't work, because it's global in a config file, thus common
to to all programs.

Either low-latency programs would get huge latency or typical mp3
players would start stuttering.

<ul>
<li>audio/mpg123
<li>audio/vorbis-tools
<li>audio/speech-dispatcher
</ul>

<h3>portaudio</h3>

There are synchronisation problems with sndio, but the same seem to
happen with alsa.

So it's not clear if the problem is caused by the sndio bits or by
audacity itself.

I was told that OS X has no problems.

<ul>
<li>audio/audacity
<li>telephony/pjsua
</ul>

<h3>pulseaudio</h3>

<p>
The following are using it, but we'de better port these to sndio and
avoid one extra software layer.

There's no point if stacking two audio servers doing the same thing.

<ul>
<li>x11/gnome/controlcenter
<li>x11/gnome/empathy
<li>x11/gnome/settings-daemon
<li>x11/gnome/shell
</ul>
